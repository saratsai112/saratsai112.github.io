    <li class = "text">tinypenguinpie is an attempt at collecting my musings, thoughts, and adventures through college and beyond. Time is something incredibly precious that I do not think I appreciated enough in the past, and I hope that through this effort I will be inspired to make the most of every moment.
Oh, wait. I forgot to introduce myself!</li>

    <li class = "text-1">Aloha! My name is Sara, and I am currently a freshman at UC Berkeley intending to study Business Administration and Interdisciplinary Studies! In high school, I was the tiny but mighty drum major of the school marching band.
      <p><i>Why the name tinypenguinpie?</i></p>
      I have always loved penguins, so when I was creating my snapchat name I wanted to incorporate it somewhere in there. Since I am tiny, I figured tinypenguin would be a good name, but that was taken, so I just made up tinypenguinpie.
      <p><i>Who drew that beautiful cover photo with the pie flying away from a distressed penguin?</i></p>
      Why, thank you for noticing! I drew it on Illustrator, and am very proud of it because I had no idea how to use the program.
      <p><i>Where are you from?</i></p>
      At Berkeley, I live in Stern Hall (AKA the all-girls dorm in an old building on top of a very hard-to-climb hill nestled at the corner of campus). My hometown is Fremont, CA!
